# Stage 7: Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implementation details for the Chassis Lab prototype.

## Project Structure

### Core Systems
- **GameManager.gd** - Central controller for game state and progression
- **DeckManager.gd** - Handles deck, hand and card operations
- **TurnManager.gd** - Controls turn sequence and player/enemy actions
- **CombatResolver.gd** - Processes combat interactions and effects
- **DataLoader.gd** - Loads card/enemy/balance data from files

### Entity Classes
- **Robot.gd** - Player-controlled entity with attachable parts
- **Enemy.gd** - Base enemy class with AI behaviors
- **Part.gd** - Base class for robot parts
- **Head.gd** - Specialized part for targeting and critical hit mechanics
- **Core.gd** - Specialized part for energy and heat management
- **Arm.gd** - Specialized part for offensive capabilities
- **Legs.gd** - Specialized part for movement and stability
- **Card.gd** - Card representation with cost, effects and targeting

### UI Components
- **DragDrop.gd** - Handles card drag and drop interactions
- **HeatMeter.gd** - Visual representation of robot heat levels
- **CardDisplay.gd** - Renders card data visually
- **CombatUI.gd** - Manages combat visuals and feedback

### Data Files
- **cards.csv** - Human-readable card data
- **enemies.csv** - Human-readable enemy data
- **cards.json** - Machine-readable card data with full details
- **enemies.json** - Machine-readable enemy data with full details
- **balance.json** - Game balance parameters and scaling values

## Key Requirements Implementation

| Requirement | Implemented In | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Drag-and-drop card system for part attachment | DragDrop.gd, Robot.gd, Card.gd | Cards can be dragged from hand and dropped onto robot chassis |
| Heat management system affecting performance | Robot.gd, Core.gd | Heat accumulates through card usage and affects robot stats |
| Part durability with breakage mechanics | Part.gd, Robot.gd, CombatResolver.gd | Parts have durability that decreases through combat damage |
| Deterministic auto-combat resolution | CombatResolver.gd, TurnManager.gd, Enemy.gd | Combat resolves automatically based on attached parts |
| Progressive enemy encounters | GameManager.gd, DataLoader.gd | Game progresses through multiple encounters with scaling difficulty |
| Card-based robot part customization | Robot.gd, DeckManager.gd, Part.gd | Player builds robot by attaching part cards to chassis |

## Object Relationships

- **GameManager** → DeckManager, TurnManager, CombatResolver, DataLoader
- **Robot** → Part, Head, Core, Arm, Legs
- **DeckManager** → Card, DataLoader
- **CombatResolver** → Robot, Enemy, TurnManager
- **TurnManager** → Robot, Enemy, GameManager

## Core Game Loop

1. Game starts with GameManager initializing systems
2. DataLoader loads card/enemy/balance data
3. DeckManager initializes player's starting deck
4. GameManager begins first encounter
5. CARD PHASE: Player draws cards and attaches/upgrades parts
6. COMBAT PHASE: TurnManager handles turn sequence
7. CombatResolver processes attacks and effects
8. If player defeats enemies, GameManager advances to next encounter
9. Player receives new card rewards
10. Loop continues until player wins or loses

## Implementation Priorities

1. Core drag-and-drop interaction for card placement
2. Heat and durability systems
3. Basic combat resolution
4. Enemy AI behaviors
5. Game progression and encounter scaling
6. Visual polish and feedback
7. Audio cues and effects
8. Balance tuning

## Next Steps

1. Review all system implementations for consistency
2. Implement the drag-drop system (highest gameplay priority)
3. Create basic UI elements for heat, energy and card display
4. Build simple test scene with Robot and basic enemies
5. Test full game loop from start to finish
6. Apply polish items from the polish checklist
7. Test balance using the test cases defined
8. Package for submission
