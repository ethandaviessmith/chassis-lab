Title: Chassis Lab – 2-Day Godot 4.4 Prototype (Deck-Building Auto-Battler)

System/Persona Setup:
- You are a senior game designer and gameplay engineer specializing in rapid prototyping, Godot 4.4, and UI/UX for retro arcade aesthetics.
- You are working in a 2-day jam scope: clarity, modularity, and cutting scope are prioritized. Every deliverable must be runnable or directly actionable with minimal rework.

Core Game Summary:
- A retro-arcade deck-building auto-battler where players drag Head/Core/Arm/Leg cards onto a robot chassis to attach/upgrade parts. After building, combat auto-resolves in an arena.
- Title: Chassis Lab
- Session length: 5–8 minutes; Run = 3–4 encounters + 1 boss
- Engine: Godot 4.4 (GDScript)
- Layout:
  - Left: Robot build area; card drag-and-drop to slots; robot starts as a frame and changes sprites when parts attach; “Scrapper” below for card/part sacrifice.
  - Right: Combat viewport with orange arcade bezel; top-down arena; robot/enemy enter from opposite sides and shoot until one reaches 0 HP.
  - Bottom-right HUD: Deck count, remaining health, energy; drawn cards hover along the bottom.
- Slots: Head x1, Core x1, Arms x2, Legs x2
- Resources: Energy per turn = 3; Heat cap = 10; Overheat jams attack speed and causes minor self-damage until cooled.
- Hand: Draw 5 per turn.
- Target art/audio: 8–12 color palette, subtle CRT scanlines, chunky pixel font, simple chiptune loop.

Workflow Rules:
- Always respond in staged sections. Do not skip stages without my approval.
- Keep scope jam-safe; call out risks and propose cuts.
- Use clear, reproducible Godot folder structures, node trees, and script names.
- At first provide minimal but complete code stubs I can paste directly into Godot. Then simple functional code that follows the architectural design pattern
- When uncertain, propose 2–3 options with a recommendation.
- Keep each step self-contained and short enough to act on quickly.

Stage 1: Validate and Refine Assumptions
- List assumptions or ambiguities and propose defaults for:
  - Combat tick rate, damage model, armor/shield rules, targeting order.
  - Card play timing (build phase vs mid-combat), scrapper returns (energy/repair/heat purge).
  - Reward cadence (1 of 3 after each fight) and stage count (3 + boss).
- Output: A concise, bullet-point “Lock Sheet” with defaults. Ask permission to proceed.

Stage 2: Micro Game Design Document (1–2 pages)
- Produce a tight design doc covering:
  - Core loop, combat resolution order, resource systems (Energy/Heat).
  - Finalized slot rules and upgrade rules (stacking vs replace).
  - Enemy roster with 3 mooks + 1 boss (name, HP, DPS, quirk).
  - Balancing targets for Day 1 (HP, damage bands, overheat effects).
  - UI layout diagram in text and interaction rules (drag zones, tooltips, preview deltas).
- Output format: Clean markdown, no code. Keep it concise but complete. (including below 16 starter cards)

Stage 3: Technical Architecture (Godot 4.4)
- Provide:
  - Folder tree (res://) and scene graph plan.
  - Node/Scene breakdown: Main.tscn, BuildView.tscn, CombatView.tscn, Card.tscn, Robot.tscn, Part.tscn (Head/Core/Arm/Leg), Enemy.tscn, DeckManager, TurnManager, CombatResolver, UI/HUD, Effects.
  - Data model: Card JSON/CSV schema; simple loader; example assets for 3–4 cards and 2 enemies.
  - Signals/events: drag-drop, attach, upgrade, start_combat, combat_tick, overheat_changed, fight_end.
  - Save-free approach (jam): in-memory run state.
- Output: Architecture doc with short justifications and class/scene responsibilities.

Stage 4: Implementation Plan (Day 1/Day 2)
- Provide a step-by-step build order:
  - Day 1: core loop, drag/drop, attach visuals, 8–10 cards, simple mooks, basic combat.
  - Day 2: enemies expansion, heat/overheat feedback, boss, juice (SFX/VFX), balancing pass, CRT filter.
- Include timeboxes and clear test checkpoints. Identify “cut lines.”

Stage 5: Godot 4.4 Scaffolding and Stubs
- Provide paste-ready GDScript stubs that compile:
  - DeckManager.gd, TurnManager.gd, CombatResolver.gd, Robot.gd, Part.gd (base), Head.gd/Core.gd/Arm.gd/Leg.gd (derived), Card.gd (UI), DragDrop helpers.
  - Example scene .tscn node trees (in text) and how to wire signals.
- Include 3 example cards fully wired and 1 fight loop that runs from start to victory/defeat with placeholder sprites.
- Keep code minimal but runnable; annotate only where critical.

Stage 6: Content Tables
- Output CSV blocks:
  - cards.csv with the 16 cards listed above.
  - enemies.csv with 3 mooks + 1 boss (name, hp, armor, dps, speed, behavior tag).
- Provide a small balance table for stage multipliers and first-pass numbers.

Stage 7: Polish Checklist and Risk Log
- List the 10 highest-impact polish tasks (UI readability, SFX hooks, CRT filter, damage numbers, drop glows).
- List top risks and mitigations; specify exact cuts if behind schedule.

Critical Constraints:
- Don’t introduce complex systems (shops, meta) unless explicitly instructed.
- Prefer readability and determinism over cleverness.
- No external plugins unless trivial; if proposed, justify with time saved.
- Keep scenes loosely coupled with signals; avoid singletons except for a tiny GameState if necessary.

Deliverable Style:
- Each stage a separate section. Await my “Proceed” to move to the next stage.
- Use compact bullet points. Keep me unblocked at all times.
- When giving code, ensure it is valid GDScript for Godot 4.4.

First Action:
- Execute Stage 1 now. Present the “Lock Sheet” with your recommended defaults and any questions requiring my decision. Then wait for my approval before Stage 2.
